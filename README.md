# Tic Tac Toe

A simple Java-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where a player competes against the computer. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the first to align three symbols (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

## Features
- User vs Computer gameplay.
- Dynamic game board display.
- Input validation to ensure valid moves.
- Simple, intuitive interface.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol (`X` for Player, `O` for Computer) on the 3x3 grid.
3. The first to align three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
4. If all positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Gameplay Controls
- The positions on the board are numbered from 1 to 9 as shown below:
 1 | 2 | 3
 4 | 5 | 6
 7 | 8 | 9
- During the player's turn, input the number corresponding to the desired position.
